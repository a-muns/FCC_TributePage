    <h3 id="headline">5 Qualities of Karma Yoga</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Samavritti</strong> - Equanimity in action. One must practice remaining uninteresting in the results of one's action.</li>
        <li><strong>Swadharma</strong> - Perform your duty. Take up the responsibilities of your life. Help the world in the way you are best suited to help.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedication of Merit</strong> - Dedicate your actions and the fruits of your actions to the welfare and enlightenment of all beings.</li>
        <li><strong>Equanimity in Results</strong> - One practices remaining content and perserverent whether the results of their work good, bad, or neither, with the understanding that they have the rights to their actions but to to the results, which are produced by the totality of that which is.</li>
        <li><strong>Prasad</strong> - The practitioner enjoys the blessings of the results whether they are seemlingly good or bad. Knowing that every moment is a result of past action, he becomes grateful for his current situation.</li>
    </ol>
